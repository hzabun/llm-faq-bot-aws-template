#### Done

- [App] Added PDF parser
  - Extracts each page of the PDF file
  - Converts pages to text
- [App] Set up ChromaDB as vector store to embed the PDF pages
  - Parsed PDF pages first get semantically chunked based on sentence punctuation via nltk library
  - Then they get embedded into the vector store with their page number as metadata
  - Lastly, a simple query delivers results for the stored chunks

#### Learned

- Remembered the nltk library today and set it up for semantic chunking of text
- Also remembered LlamaIndex, might be worth looking into it again
